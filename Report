So as I carefully analyzed the different drugs within the data base as well as the effect they have on the tumor size,
it was clear to see that the Capomulin drug clearly had the biggest data impacts throughout all the data. It was the
drug with more regular used and had a positive impact especially with regards to decreasing the size of the tumors. For example, 
on average Capomulin was very effective with decreasing the tumor volume (size) from (45mm t0 36.2mm ) which was significant.

•	We are able to see that the linear regresion model the correlation betweeen the mouse weight versus the 
average tumor volume which is called the Capomulin drug. We are able to see the positive relationship between the weight and 
the tumor (size). In other words, we are able to conclude that as the weight of the mouse increased the tumor volume (size)
increased as well. 

•	I also concluded that the Capomulin drug had a significant impact on certain mouses. For example, I took mouse l509 and creted a 
line plot with the data I gather from the csv files. I was able to compare the tumor volume (size) of specifically mouse l509 to
the change after receiving the Capomulin drug. After plotting the information we are able to see that within thirty five days of treatment
the tumor size had decreased by more than ten percent of the data.
