So, as I carefully analyzed the different drugs within the data base as well as the effect they have on the tumor size,
It was clear to see that the Capulin drug clearly had the biggest data impacts throughout all the data. It was the
drug with more regular use and had a positive impact especially with regards to decreasing the size of the tumors. For example, 
On average Capulin was amazingly effective with decreasing the tumor volume (size) from (45mm t0 36.2mm) which was significant.

•	We can see that the linear regression models the correlation between the mouse weight versus the 
average tumor volume which the Capulin drug. We can see the positive relationship between the weight and 
the tumor (size). In other words, we can conclude that as the weight of the mouse increased the tumor volume (size)
increased as well. 

•	I also concluded that the Capulin drug had a significant impact on certain mice. For example, I took mouse l509 and created a 
line plot with the data I gather from the csv files. I was able to compare the tumor volume (size) of specifically mouse l509 to
the change after receiving the Capulin drug. After plotting the information, we can see that within thirty-five days of treatment.
the tumor size had decreased by more than ten percent of the data.
